# Session 02: Describing the UI

## üí™ Motivation

This session will deepen your understanding of component hierarchy and data flow in React applications.

You'll learn to manage data and rendering within React components, which is essential for creating user interfaces. 

## üéØ Learning objectives

- Deeper understanding of React component composition
- Knowing how to pass data to React components with `props`
- Understanding the data flow in React applications
- Rendering data from arrays with `map`
- Applying the `key` prop
- Using the `children` prop
- Knowing React Fragments
- Using the "React Developer Tools" Chrome extension
- Integration of 3rd-party UI components (like `react-icons`)
